3,5f99255fde30145801186bde,Video Games & Consoles,Video Game Consoles,Microsoft Xbox One Day One Edition 500GB Black Console,4.5,"sed this review off of previous experience with older models of the x box and the features that are offered.  My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,4.0,nmcc6331,"Dec 13, 2013"

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,hoadncom,"Jan 24, 2014"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about. The Bumpers on the controller are a little bit annoying",594,5.0,payaamt,"Dec 31, 2013"

This is my first time every owning any kind of console-related camera but I must say the kinect really blew me away. Not only does voice command make things even more effortless but it also has gesture commands. As if that wasnt enough, if you add the microsoft smartglass app on your mobile devices it is almost the same as having another remote. It integrates as a remote seamlessly. There is just so much this system has to offer and I feel like I have only scratched the surface. The ONLY setback I found so far is that if you choose to hook up your cable box to the One in order to use the snap feature, you then in turn cannot watch cable without the One being on. That isnt as big a problem as you think since the power brick has a fan in it and the console has both top and side vents(Microsoft finally learned their lesson with overheating).

Well I have Battlefield 4 and just that one game is vast enough for me. It is so realistic and fun, it even takes voice commands like ""RELOAD"" then reloads your weapon.

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for.

So I can't complain too much.Besides the disc drive issue, the console is a superb machine.  The Kinect finally becomes decent for everyday use (if you watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever -- saying ""Xbox Pause"" is a lot easier than waiting for the controller to turn back on, then pausing), actually works in an apartment, and the console is quiet as a mouse.  After playing Battlefield 4 for a good 7 hours, still didn't hear anything.The One can also integrate with your cable setup - I have FIOS, so this worked alright, though it takes a little bit to setup.  Apparently the console can also control volume on the TV depending on the model/manufacturer, but it didn't work with mine (LG 42PT350).  Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).  Killer Instinct was loads of fun, though only getting one character is a shame.So, all-in-all, a great console.

42,5f992664de30145801186c05,Video Games & Consoles,Video Game Consoles,Microsoft Xbox One Day One Edition 500GB Black Console,4.5,"sed this review off of previous experience with older models of the x box and the features that are offered.  My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,4.0,nmcc6331,"Dec 13, 2013"

Great games are coming in the future and I am nothing but pleased with my purchase so far. It will be quite a while before the first price drop so if you don't want to wait a year for it, bite the bullet and get one now.

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial.

My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4.

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,hoadncom,"Jan 24, 2014"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about. The Bumpers on the controller are a little bit annoying",594,5.0,payaamt,"Dec 31, 2013"

This is my first time every owning any kind of console-related camera but I must say the kinect really blew me away. Not only does voice command make things even more effortless but it also has gesture commands. As if that wasnt enough, if you add the microsoft smartglass app on your mobile devices it is almost the same as having another remote. It integrates as a remote seamlessly. There is just so much this system has to offer and I feel like I have only scratched the surface. The ONLY setback I found so far is that if you choose to hook up your cable box to the One in order to use the snap feature, you then in turn cannot watch cable without the One being on. That isnt as big a problem as you think since the power brick has a fan in it and the console has both top and side vents(Microsoft finally learned their lesson with overheating).

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about.

So I can't complain too much.Besides the disc drive issue, the console is a superb machine.  The Kinect finally becomes decent for everyday use (if you watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever -- saying ""Xbox Pause"" is a lot easier than waiting for the controller to turn back on, then pausing), actually works in an apartment, and the console is quiet as a mouse.  After playing Battlefield 4 for a good 7 hours, still didn't hear anything.The One can also integrate with your cable setup - I have FIOS, so this worked alright, though it takes a little bit to setup.  Apparently the console can also control volume on the TV depending on the model/manufacturer, but it didn't work with mine (LG 42PT350).  Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).  Killer Instinct was loads of fun, though only getting one character is a shame.So, all-in-all, a great console.

102,5f9927fade30145801186c41,Video Games & Consoles,Video Game Consoles,Microsoft Xbox One Day One Edition 500GB Black Console,4.5,"sed this review off of previous experience with older models of the x box and the features that are offered.  My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,4.0,nmcc6331,"Dec 13, 2013"

Great games are coming in the future and I am nothing but pleased with my purchase so far. It will be quite a while before the first price drop so if you don't want to wait a year for it, bite the bullet and get one now.

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,hoadncom,"Jan 24, 2014"

Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).

122,5f992882de30145801186c55,Video Games & Consoles,Video Game Consoles,Microsoft Xbox One Day One Edition 500GB Black Console,4.5,"sed this review off of previous experience with older models of the x box and the features that are offered.  My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,4.0,nmcc6331,"Dec 13, 2013"

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,hoadncom,"Jan 24, 2014"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about. The Bumpers on the controller are a little bit annoying",594,5.0,payaamt,"Dec 31, 2013"

This is my first time every owning any kind of console-related camera but I must say the kinect really blew me away. Not only does voice command make things even more effortless but it also has gesture commands. As if that wasnt enough, if you add the microsoft smartglass app on your mobile devices it is almost the same as having another remote. It integrates as a remote seamlessly. There is just so much this system has to offer and I feel like I have only scratched the surface. The ONLY setback I found so far is that if you choose to hook up your cable box to the One in order to use the snap feature, you then in turn cannot watch cable without the One being on. That isnt as big a problem as you think since the power brick has a fan in it and the console has both top and side vents(Microsoft finally learned their lesson with overheating).

There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about. The Bumpers on the controller are a little bit annoying",594,5.0,hoadncom,"Jan 24, 2014"

My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,4.0,qgerlach2004,"Dec 02, 2013"

Great games are coming in the future and I am nothing but pleased with my purchase so far.

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,mikwoodbridg0,"Jan 17, 2017"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4.

The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,4.0,nmcc6331,"Dec 13, 2013"

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,hoadncom,"Jan 24, 2014"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about.

So I can't complain too much.Besides the disc drive issue, the console is a superb machine.  The Kinect finally becomes decent for everyday use (if you watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever -- saying ""Xbox Pause"" is a lot easier than waiting for the controller to turn back on, then pausing), actually works in an apartment, and the console is quiet as a mouse.  After playing Battlefield 4 for a good 7 hours, still didn't hear anything.The One can also integrate with your cable setup - I have FIOS, so this worked alright, though it takes a little bit to setup.  Apparently the console can also control volume on the TV depending on the model/manufacturer, but it didn't work with mine (LG 42PT350).  Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).  Killer Instinct was loads of fun, though only getting one character is a shame.So, all-in-all, a great console.

My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming.

So I can't complain too much.Besides the disc drive issue, the console is a superb machine.  The Kinect finally becomes decent for everyday use (if you watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever -- saying ""Xbox Pause"" is a lot easier than waiting for the controller to turn back on, then pausing), actually works in an apartment, and the console is quiet as a mouse.  After playing Battlefield 4 for a good 7 hours, still didn't hear anything.The One can also integrate with your cable setup - I have FIOS, so this worked alright, though it takes a little bit to setup.  Apparently the console can also control volume on the TV depending on the model/manufacturer, but it didn't work with mine (LG 42PT350).  Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).

My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4.

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,hoadncom,"Jan 24, 2014"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about. The Bumpers on the controller are a little bit annoying",594,5.0,payaamt,"Dec 31, 2013"

This is my first time every owning any kind of console-related camera but I must say the kinect really blew me away. Not only does voice command make things even more effortless but it also has gesture commands. As if that wasnt enough, if you add the microsoft smartglass app on your mobile devices it is almost the same as having another remote. It integrates as a remote seamlessly. There is just so much this system has to offer and I feel like I have only scratched the surface. The ONLY setback I found so far is that if you choose to hook up your cable box to the One in order to use the snap feature, you then in turn cannot watch cable without the One being on. That isnt as big a problem as you think since the power brick has a fan in it and the console has both top and side vents(Microsoft finally learned their lesson with overheating).

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,hoadncom,"Jan 24, 2014"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about.

There is just so much this system has to offer and I feel like I have only scratched the surface.

So I can't complain too much.Besides the disc drive issue, the console is a superb machine.  The Kinect finally becomes decent for everyday use (if you watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever -- saying ""Xbox Pause"" is a lot easier than waiting for the controller to turn back on, then pausing), actually works in an apartment, and the console is quiet as a mouse.  After playing Battlefield 4 for a good 7 hours, still didn't hear anything.The One can also integrate with your cable setup - I have FIOS, so this worked alright, though it takes a little bit to setup.  Apparently the console can also control volume on the TV depending on the model/manufacturer, but it didn't work with mine (LG 42PT350).  Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).  Killer Instinct was loads of fun, though only getting one character is a shame.So, all-in-all, a great console.

260,5f992c38de30145801186cdf,Video Games & Consoles,Video Game Consoles,Microsoft Xbox One Day One Edition 500GB Black Console,4.5,"sed this review off of previous experience with older models of the x box and the features that are offered.  My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,4.0,nmcc6331,"Dec 13, 2013"

So I can't complain too much.Besides the disc drive issue, the console is a superb machine.  The Kinect finally becomes decent for everyday use (if you watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever -- saying ""Xbox Pause"" is a lot easier than waiting for the controller to turn back on, then pausing), actually works in an apartment, and the console is quiet as a mouse.  After playing Battlefield 4 for a good 7 hours, still didn't hear anything.The One can also integrate with your cable setup - I have FIOS, so this worked alright, though it takes a little bit to setup.  Apparently the console can also control volume on the TV depending on the model/manufacturer, but it didn't work with mine (LG 42PT350).  Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).  Killer Instinct was loads of fun, though only getting one character is a shame.So, all-in-all, a great console.

My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,5.0,schutkid,"Nov 11, 2019"

Great games are coming in the future and I am nothing but pleased with my purchase so far. It will be quite a while before the first price drop so if you don't want to wait a year for it, bite the bullet and get one now.

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,4.0,minitorr,"Dec 02, 2013"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about.

This is my first time every owning any kind of console-related camera but I must say the kinect really blew me away. Not only does voice command make things even more effortless but it also has gesture commands. As if that wasnt enough, if you add the microsoft smartglass app on your mobile devices it is almost the same as having another remote. It integrates as a remote seamlessly. There is just so much this system has to offer and I feel like I have only scratched the surface. The ONLY setback I found so far is that if you choose to hook up your cable box to the One in order to use the snap feature, you then in turn cannot watch cable without the One being on. That isnt as big a problem as you think since the power brick has a fan in it and the console has both top and side vents(Microsoft finally learned their lesson with overheating).

So I can't complain too much.Besides the disc drive issue, the console is a superb machine.  The Kinect finally becomes decent for everyday use (if you watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever -- saying ""Xbox Pause"" is a lot easier than waiting for the controller to turn back on, then pausing), actually works in an apartment, and the console is quiet as a mouse.  After playing Battlefield 4 for a good 7 hours, still didn't hear anything.The One can also integrate with your cable setup - I have FIOS, so this worked alright, though it takes a little bit to setup.  Apparently the console can also control volume on the TV depending on the model/manufacturer, but it didn't work with mine (LG 42PT350).  Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).  Killer Instinct was loads of fun, though only getting one character is a shame.So, all-in-all, a great console.

314,5f992daede30145801186d15,Video Games & Consoles,Video Game Consoles,Microsoft Xbox One Day One Edition 500GB Black Console,4.5,"sed this review off of previous experience with older models of the x box and the features that are offered.  My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,4.0,qgerlach2004,"Dec 02, 2013"

Great games are coming in the future and I am nothing but pleased with my purchase so far. It will be quite a while before the first price drop so if you don't want to wait a year for it, bite the bullet and get one now. If you can wait the year to save about 100 dollars, more power too you.

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,mikwoodbridg0,"Jan 17, 2017"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for.

The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4.

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,hoadncom,"Jan 24, 2014"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about.

So I can't complain too much.Besides the disc drive issue, the console is a superb machine.  The Kinect finally becomes decent for everyday use (if you watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever -- saying ""Xbox Pause"" is a lot easier than waiting for the controller to turn back on, then pausing), actually works in an apartment, and the console is quiet as a mouse.  After playing Battlefield 4 for a good 7 hours, still didn't hear anything.The One can also integrate with your cable setup - I have FIOS, so this worked alright, though it takes a little bit to setup.  Apparently the console can also control volume on the TV depending on the model/manufacturer, but it didn't work with mine (LG 42PT350).  Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).  Killer Instinct was loads of fun, though only getting one character is a shame.So, all-in-all, a great console.  Just needs a more diverse lineup to show its stuff.",265,5.0,elperro220,"Dec 04, 2016"
353,5f992ebfde30145801186d3c,Video Games & Consoles,Video Game Consoles,Microsoft Xbox One Day One Edition 500GB Black Console,4.5,"sed this review off of previous experience with older models of the x box and the features that are offered.  My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system.

So I can't complain too much.Besides the disc drive issue, the console is a superb machine.  The Kinect finally becomes decent for everyday use (if you watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever -- saying ""Xbox Pause"" is a lot easier than waiting for the controller to turn back on, then pausing), actually works in an apartment, and the console is quiet as a mouse.  After playing Battlefield 4 for a good 7 hours, still didn't hear anything.The One can also integrate with your cable setup - I have FIOS, so this worked alright, though it takes a little bit to setup.  Apparently the console can also control volume on the TV depending on the model/manufacturer, but it didn't work with mine (LG 42PT350).  Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).  Killer Instinct was loads of fun, though only getting one character is a shame.So, all-in-all, a great console.

373,5f992f54de30145801186d50,Video Games & Consoles,Video Game Consoles,Microsoft Xbox One Day One Edition 500GB Black Console,4.5,"sed this review off of previous experience with older models of the x box and the features that are offered.  My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,4.0,nmcc6331,"Dec 13, 2013"

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console. Yes, the interface is different, but they could have done this with an update to the existing 360.Bottom Line:The Bottom Line is that this console was clearly rushed out before it was ready. There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,5.0,hoadncom,"Jan 24, 2014"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about. The Bumpers on the controller are a little bit annoying",594,5.0,payaamt,"Dec 31, 2013"

This is my first time every owning any kind of console-related camera but I must say the kinect really blew me away. Not only does voice command make things even more effortless but it also has gesture commands. As if that wasnt enough, if you add the microsoft smartglass app on your mobile devices it is almost the same as having another remote. It integrates as a remote seamlessly. There is just so much this system has to offer and I feel like I have only scratched the surface. The ONLY setback I found so far is that if you choose to hook up your cable box to the One in order to use the snap feature, you then in turn cannot watch cable without the One being on. That isnt as big a problem as you think since the power brick has a fan in it and the console has both top and side vents(Microsoft finally learned their lesson with overheating).

There is very little content, and essential content is not there. There are no little inexpensive games to fill the gaps. There are no demos to get a better idea of what this console can really do. The Kinect has yet to prove that its vastly superior to the original Kinect, and the controller feels a bit like a step back compared to the 360 controller.A solid system; I definitely do not regret my purchase. 4.5 stars.",343,4.0,nmcc6331,"Dec 13, 2013"

That's generally speaking; now let’s get into more detail.[Downloading] So the first thing right off the bat that you will notice is having to download many things including the update, apps, and video games to the hard drive. Luckily my internet speed is above average and I was able to download the update within 8 minutes, but the game downloads take closer to 25 minutes due to size. Fortunately the Xbox allows you to start playing once the game is half way done downloading, but not all features are ready by that point. Considering that you will not be downloading multitudes of games at once except for the very first time, it is not too much of a hassle. You can explore other features of the Xbox while you wait. 4.5/5[Graphics] Whoa whoa.. whoa.. whoa.... whoa.... Louis this ain't my Batman cup.Alright but seriously, the graphics have blown my mind into a million little pixels of mixtures of RGB colors that create a satisfying sensation in my brain that increase my levels of serotonin. In translation, THESE GRAPHICS ARE FREAKING AWESOME! I currently own Madden, FIFA, and Battlefield. Battlefield showed an amazing difference in graphics that left my jaw dropping to the floor. The details in every inch, the vivid and accurate colors, the mass destruction, all brought the battlefield to life. Given that Battlefield is along with the very first Xbox one games, the road ahead is very long and the capabilities the Xbox has is sometimes hard to believe what is possible in the future. There is not much difference between the graphics of PS4 and Xbox one so that should not make you choose one or the other. But compared to the last generation, this is a huge improvement that is worth the money just for the graphics. 4.9/5[Features] Well this is where the Xbox goes passed the PS4. Some things like Netflix and Amazon video are still there, it is the things like the ability to Skype, watch cable TV, do Xbox Fitness, and watch NFL games, and using snap, that really had me go towards the Xbox. There is almost no lag when watching TV through the Xbox which is something that was very well done. But the main feature that I find the most helpful is Xbox Fitness. There are not as many workouts as I had hoped but I think as time goes on they will continue to integrate more videos to work with the Fitness app. I was very surprised with how well the kinect was able to register my body movements. It was very fun how they would set a multiplier for doing to the move correctly and setting challenges in order to get achievements. This really makes exercising fun, which is something I REALLY need. The snap feature was also one of my favorites. I am able to play video games while another family member can be watching some TV, kind of like a PIP. A lot can be done with the Xbox, and I'm expecting many more apps to come out.  4.7/5[Controller] Xbox 360 had the best controller by far. There was nothing better that I could ask for. Guess what, it got better. Xbox has been making a big deal out of the D-pad. It is true that it functions much better, but it wasn't worth making such a big deal about.

So I can't complain too much.Besides the disc drive issue, the console is a superb machine.  The Kinect finally becomes decent for everyday use (if you watch Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, whatever -- saying ""Xbox Pause"" is a lot easier than waiting for the controller to turn back on, then pausing), actually works in an apartment, and the console is quiet as a mouse.  After playing Battlefield 4 for a good 7 hours, still didn't hear anything.The One can also integrate with your cable setup - I have FIOS, so this worked alright, though it takes a little bit to setup.  Apparently the console can also control volume on the TV depending on the model/manufacturer, but it didn't work with mine (LG 42PT350).  Verizon is supposed to be coming out with an app that works better, but for now, the whole setup works alright.  Did I buy it for that?  No, but it could be interesting, if it becomes a little of a hassle to do.I would only tell people to wait if the admittedly pathetic lineup of launch games doesn't interest you (I was really looking forward to Watch Dogs being a launch game - darn).  Killer Instinct was loads of fun, though only getting one character is a shame.So, all-in-all, a great console.

410,5f993077de30145801186d75,Video Games & Consoles,Video Game Consoles,Microsoft Xbox One Day One Edition 500GB Black Console,4.5,"sed this review off of previous experience with older models of the x box and the features that are offered.  My source from which I was able to test one, bought one of these first hand so I was able to gain access to play, as the overbearing price for this console is staggering I was unable to afford one for myself.Everything has changed from the older generation X box so it was a bit getting used to, from the new user interface to  the controller and everything in between, it has been completely reworked to support the new age of gaming. I think the only thing that has not changed is the same old black box look that so many already have sitting on their shelves but other than that, it has a new very sharp design. The disc tray seems sturdier than previous models and works flawlessly. The hardware throughout the X box one has been updated to withstand the new memory requirements to play modern games and I must say it runs seamlessly compared to the older model 360s that are quickly become outdated. The new updated system is very quiet it can barely be heard even when the room is quiet. The new controllers are actually one of the best additions to the new X box system. They are of much better quality and the sensitivity of the controls has greatly improved over the last models adding to the overall gaming experience as control over the game has become increasingly more important with the competitive online gaming. The thumb sticks are super grippy and the shape fits hands a bit better allowing for longer and more comfortable game play. I would say the quality of the headset that comes with the new X box system is rather poor and could use some work. There is no head adjustment on the headset it is just one solid piece of flimsy plastic, something that was obviously meant to be upgraded if you are a serious gamer.The new Kinect system is quite wonderful for several reasons, one being that you no longer have to enter the long QR codes to get downloaded content. Now all you have to do is hold the code up for the kinetic to see and it is instantly entered, no more entering ridiculously long codes for content. The voice commands are fun to use and play with, what is better than giving voice commands to your gaming system. The Kinect works quite well in loud rooms as well as the commands for the X box it has not once had a hard time picking up the voice commands it needs. The power unit for the new system has been left outside of the box much like the older generation 360s which is a plus considering the heat they put off, this will greatly improve the overall life of the X box. Microsoft has included a nice 4k HDMI cord given this is the most modern way to get the quality we want out of our picture, something no previously included in the purchase of an X box system. The actually box is quite study and feels like the time and effort was put into making it that way , as we all know these things all hit the floor at some point in their lives.My overall generally impression of the new X Box one is good, I believe Microsoft has made another great product to compete with other gaming systems like the ps4. I enjoyed the gaming experience and was fully involved while I was playing and this I think is the best new feature added to current models",614,4.0,nmcc6331,"Dec 13, 2013"

Great games are coming in the future and I am nothing but pleased with my purchase so far.

The picture quality seems on par with my Samsung Smart TV camera, although it's nice that I can be much closer to the TV and still be seen. At first it wouldn't work with any games (for gestures). I had to go into the configuration settings several times before it finally pointed out that it couldn't identify my floor (I have very dark carpet). It allowed me to adjust where my floor was (by raising and lowering a virtual floor image) and then it worked. Movement is working ok at this point. Voice control is very hit and miss. I usually have to speak commands at least twice to get it to respond to my voice.Controller:The new controller is also a little bit disappointing. It connects and responds just fine. It feels a little smaller in my hands than the 360 controller did. It definitely feels cheaper as well. The plastic that makes up the body of the controller is noticeably thinner and feels much less substantial. The D-Pad is definitely more responsive, but has a loud annoying click when you press the buttons. Other than that, it works as expected.Performance:I'd have to say at this point that I'm really not getting a ""next-gen"" vibe from this console.

Load times are so fast; it's almost like ""instant on"" when I power it up.Download speeds from PSN are PATHETIC! I have a 30mbs service from my ISP. However my PS4 only reports a download speed of 611kbs. One of the games that came with the system is ""The Last Of Us""; it's been downloading for 24 hours and still reports it will be another 99 hours!. My network is hard wired with cat 6 Ethernet. My modem and router, and switches are Gigabit rated. At this time the only machine that is active on the internet is the PS4. The PC Pitstop bandwidth speed test reports a download speed of 22mbs. Why can't Sony do any better than a SLOW DSL connection? When I upgraded the HDD; I went to the Sony site to download the latest system software. It was a 700mb download on my PC. It took less than 4 minutes to download. There is something wrong with the PS4 when it comes to connectivity. When attempting to view trailers for games they offer; Sony's videos buffered every 20 seconds. I gave up trying to watch videos of games I was interested in. The trailers are best viewed on a PC. If they were working from the PS4; you can go to the store and purchase the game right there. That inconvenience could nix a possible sale from the impulse buyers among us!I'm just getting started with the PS4 and that 500GB HDD is almost half full already. Based on my experience with the PS3; I imagined that 500GB in storage would be plenty. It ain't! With only 3 games installed and 30GB of data in Que; it'll be over half full!If you've read this far, and thinking about putting in a larger HDD: go with a 2TB HDD. Especially if you want to put some music or videos in there. The only data on my HDD right now is all Sony related. I'm not sure about the PS4; but the PS3 won't make any playlists unless the music is on the HDD.Like I said in the ""bottom line""; ""LOTS OF POTENTIAL"". The graphics capability of the PS4 beats the Xbox 1, hands down. Good gaming is really all about the graphics and frame rates.I recommend the PS4. It's awesome!",384,4.0,sc00ter31348,"Jul 23, 2015"

I wish there where more games out but I imagine making games for this console takes a extremely long time to create for, being a Developer myself I understand this more than others who don't know about the process or making video games. The menu system is easy as heck to navigate threw and there are also some very nice options on different things to do besides gaming.

Just wish Metal Gear Solid for PS1 would have a remake on the PS4. However, Metal Gear Solid Legacy Collection is quite awesome. I saw the way Solid Snake looked on the cover, and thought maybe the graphics would be upgraded. Although that wasn't the case, the game is still awesome. Would also like a remake for the highly popular game Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Classic game on a classic system. Quite possibly the best game ever in the series. Just beat Arkham Knight and The Order 1886. Didn't get the best ending in Arkham Knight, but it was a thrill to play. The Order 1886 is the real reason I got a PS4. Games like that have always captured my attention. Also Tomb Raider, yet another classic game series. That game is, to me, an edge of your seat game all the way through. True survival game. Just wish Rise of the Tomb Raider was exclusively on PS4, since the first games came out only on Playstation. But I'm a true Playstation fan, so I'll wait for Rise of the Tomb Raider to come out on PS4. Had only one problem with Playstation and that was due to a faulty game. Other than that, every system has performed better than expected. Really like the slim PS3 as well. Had a super slim system, but the look and feel of the slim one is just so awesome. Next game on the list is The Last of Us. And maybe Rainbow Six Siege. Kinda lost interest in that game when I found it was going from an ingrown terrorism task force to more of a multi player game. But nevertheless, Sony Playstation is my favorite modern game system. Really can't say anything negative about it. Also I got a fitted controller cover that looks awesome and feels great. Highly recommended to keep your controller clean. Oh and also recommend downloading the Bionic Commando and Double Dragon Neon on the Playstation Network. Main thing is, in my opinion, the Playstation systems are top of the line. Wouldn't rather have any other system, except for the old school 8 bit Nintendo.

I think it launched with great games, if not one of the best launches of consoles. I had everything from Call of Duty, Battlefield, Killzone, Need for Speed, Assassins' Creed, Resogun.None of those games felt like next generation, well maybe Killzone but I think Infamous Second Son and MGS are the first true NEXT GEN games for the PS4. I played them and completed the games and they really makes use of the PS4 Power.Starting Up the PS4 is super fast compared to any other console out there right now. I love how fast you can go in and out of the game. You can check your trophies really quick this time around. Sony has learn from all the mistakes they did with the PS3The Controller for the PS4 is one of my favorite all time. I love how the analog sticks are made with the indention so it keeps your fingers from coming off. The L2 and R2 greatly improved from the PS3 i enjoy playing shooter games more now.The only thing I dislike about the PS4 is that there are no major RPG games out yet and Minecraft is not out for it yet. But that will change later this year. There are plenty of awesome indie games on the PS4 some of them are FREE so I can't complain about that.",244,5.0,premiumpanda,"May 05, 2014"

497,5f99334bde30145801186dcc,Video Games & Consoles,Video Game Consoles,Sony PlayStation 4 500GB Jet Black Console,4.6,"nts to begin with is the user friendly interface. PS4 offers a much simpler interface compared to PS3 in my personal opinion. I like how quick the machine loads, it's a beast at loading with an 8 Core processor. The Jaguar Graphics card is very good crisp and clear. I suggest running this system on a 1080p resolution HD TV to get the best quality picture. I have purchased two games so far on launch: Killzone Shadow Fall. I highly suggest this game for multiplayer much more of the story which don't last that long only 10 chapters. But there is plenty of extra to do. The graphics are very clear, but honestly for 2013 going on 2014 I was expecting a more powerful Graphics card. With that being said the work on PS4 began in 2008. I am really looking forward to next years titles, I think Playstation is going to deliver on this console big time and personally I think is going to win the console war for this current 8th generation. The price is right $399.99 USD on launch. Offers Blue Ray dvd and regular dvd such as last time. All games are made on Blue Ray discs now, reason being is massive amounts of data to put on the disc, not sure the exact number capacity and each game variates depending on the how long the game is, details such as texture map etc. I have no problem with PS4 such as overheating, plenty of cooling fans, no red ring of death like xbox 360 did. I love the design and the new controller is way more advance, I love the new dualshock 4 controller! It features a built in speaker which interacts with gameplay, better rumble features built into the controller. The most unique feature about the controller is the touch pad which is awesome in Killzone with your drone. The most unique feature I found out so far with PS4 is being able to stream live with Twitch.tv a website for gamers to show off their gameplay footage live steraming. The only problem I have encountered is some technical errors when streaming live sometimes on twitch.tv and other errors, which I'm sure in time will be patched being brought to Sony's attention. What makes PS4 different from PS3 is in order to play games online you must pay $49.99 per year for Playstation Plus. I think it kind of sucks they started doing that but all and all might improve, hopefully, our online gaming experience. I love how you can upgrade the Memory easier. A few complaints I have is not being able to play music Cd's and uploading mp3 songs. Now they charge with this music program called ""Music Unlimited"". I am very pissed off that PS4 isn't backward compatible with PS3 games. That is by far my biggest complaints. Other than that your looking at the most powerful home console of this 8th Generation. I recommend picking up Need for Speed Rivals, Killzone Shadow Fall, and Resogun, which is downloadable on the PS4 network. Downloading games is much faster and simpler as well! A must own for this 2013 Christmas! Enjoy your PS4, I know I will!",535,4.0,angelmoooo,"Nov 19, 2013"

I also thought there was a better selection of exclusives (Demon's Souls, Uncharted, The Last of Us, Killzone, Resistance, God of War, Infamous, Little Big Planet, Metal Gear Solid 4, Ratchet and Clank, SOCOM, etc.), whereas the 360 only had a few (Halo, Gears of War, Forza, Kameo, and a few PC ports like Left 4 Dead and The Witcher 2: Assassin's of Kings). Also, generally, Sony is just better to its customers than Microsoft is.After hearing about the PS4 getting exclusivity rights to Bloodborne (which is being developed by the same company and with a similar gameplay aesthetic to Demon's Souls and Dark Souls), I decided to go with the PS4 as my next-gen console of choice as the Souls series is one of my favorites. The PS4 was also a decent amount cheaper than the Xbox One and had more interesting exclusives to me, like Infamous: Second Son and Killzone: Shadowfall. That combined with the fact that TigerDirect was having a flash deal on Ebay where the console was $40 off (and didn't have any sales tax!) convinced me to jump on getting one now instead of later. Plus, there were some fantastic looking remasters of PS3 games coming out that looked like they might be worth a buy instead of their original versions, namely The Last of Us and Grand Theft Auto V.Unfortunately, I have yet to find a reason to purchase a second controller, which has left me feeling that the console might as well not even have the option to connect multiple controllers. I grew up playing local multiplayer (especially co-op) with my brother and we have yet to find any games that allow us to play together on the console even though it has been out for almost a year. There are a few like the downloadable title Octodad: Dadliest Catch and the updated version of Injustice: Gods Among Us, but neither of us are big fighting game fans and the cooperative portion of Octodad loses its luster after a few playthroughs. As cooperative multiplayer is my favorite part of video games, I really hope they eventually give me more of a reason to get a second controller.Another negative thing about the console is that it has a very weak selection of games to appeal to most audiences. I have thus far only purchased two video games (Infamous: Second Son and Killzone: Shadow Fall) for the console. I feel that there aren't many more games set to arrive in the coming months and I would really like to build up my library if possible, but not much is looking appealing. It'd be cool if they would get some more decent action/shooter games and RPGs out, especially since I think they would appeal to a large portion of the people who have a PS4.",473,4.0,estranged520,"Aug 06, 2014"

I highly recommend this console to anyone who is passionate about gaming... just do a little research first about what games you think you can't live without and decide on a console based on those exclusive games.One piece of information that is important to consider while shopping for this console during a high demand period... don't forget to calculate the total of your purchase including tax from your area. The bundle I bought was $560 after shipping, if i had bought it in a store it would have cost $555... $5 isn't a bad loss for buying in the first month of the console's release. If you don't have sales tax in your area, then good luck finding a PS4 right now for $399. I don't recommend paying too much more than retail just yet, the system will be offering much more in the coming months, but right now a higher price tag would not justify the current features and games.Happy gaming and good luck bidding.",208,4.0,nikosdeals,"Jan 13, 2014"

Don't get me wrong, the PS4 controller is fun and very innovative, but when I'm trying to ""kill or be killed"" while playing Ghosts or Battlefield 4, I need every advantage I can get--and the feel and control of the Xbox controllers gives me that.--All in all, the PlayStation 4 gives me what I want when it comes to gaming.

Sony's remotes have been basically the same since PS and the change threw me off. I had a hard to find the pause button while playing...I would usually press the touchpad, but its easy to adapt to. He touchpad is cool when the game incorporates its use....otherwise it seems like a waste of new tech. I do really like the curvature in the trigger buttons. Make it easier to use the L2/R2 buttons. My biggest complaint which is a BIG complaint however is the lack of games and of course backwards comparability. If games are still coming out for ps3 then why buy a ps4? PS3 has the great games we've grown to love over the almost 7 years PLUS new games available to the ps4. Backwards comparability plus new goes ONLY for ps4 wouldve been sooo much better and an amazing marketing ploy.

It won the hearts and minds of many from the word go, with lots of prospective next-genners left feeling alienated by some of Microsoft's bizarre policies and choices for the Xbox One – many of which were reversed as a result of a backlash.Coming in at £350, the PS4 is also £80 cheaper than the Xbox One, making it appear terrific value. It doesn't come with the PlayStation Camera (the One does come with Kinect) but this can be bought separately for £45 if you so wish.The differences between the PS4 and Xbox One are actually evident before you even switch them on. Despite the two consoles both sporting similar half-matte half-gloss finishes and containing very similar internal components, they really couldn't be more different.For a start, the PS4 is small and sleek in comparison to the enormous VCR-like square cuboid of the Xbox One.

I wish there were more games for it out but I think there are a few coming out that will make up for it. Overall I love the ps4 and the controller is pretty neat with the headphone jack. It cuts the sound off of the tv and it all goes through the headset so I'm not disturbing everybody when I'm playing at night. Now the joystick rubber is pretty awful. Don't get me wrong it feels great in your hands while playing a game but why does it peel so bad? PS3 controllers had hard rubber that you had to work to make fall apart.

Согласитесь, что платить 60$ за игру довольно много, нежели на РС вы можете купить ее за 15$, а то и меньше. И повторю еще раз для меня приставка хороша абсолютно всем!!!!По сравнению с моим старым xbox 360, эта консоль рвет ее на части. Шума, практически нету и то если он есть-это значит, что дисковод диск крутить начал. Можно загружать игры поставив консоль в режим ожидания, нежели на консоли xbox 360, где его по моему и не было. Джойстик тоже достаточно удобен, я думал, что долго не смогу привыкнуть к расположению стиков, однако, я ошибался и привык в тот же день.И кончено же, большое спасибо steve94rf за то , что продал мне на столько замечательную консоль и сделал все как обещал!!",123,5.0,1197018669@deleted,"Feb 11, 2014"

I’m sold. I’m giving away all my older 12 and 18 volt drills and switching over to these drills.

I’m sold. I’m giving away all my older 12 and 18 volt drills and switching over to these drills. Now that I’m older and my strength leaving me, I appreciate the smaller size but particularly this drills light weight. It’s simply a tool I use a lot like a trusted friend. In fact I like so well I just bought 2 more 791B drills. I also like the added led that illuminates your work. These drills are getting smaller, lighter and more powerful each year. If you are hesitating on this purchase, don’t! Just buy and enjoy !",112,5.0,janonkuls13janis,"Apr 17, 2019"

Modern, strong, high torque, and bright light. The belt clip can be removed. The only thing I wish these drills had was a place to clip on a screw bit (you know, flat blade and Phillips head combo deals). With a 2.0 aH battery, it is perfectly balanced. My old DeWalt brushed drill was NOT balanced and gave my wrists fatigue after all day use. Not this one...VERY comfortable. Much more gooder!",82,5.0,hayderj,"Oct 16, 2017"
